description: Multi-source research. Queries Exa for web results, the user's local QMD knowledge base collections if installed, and the user's own past context in the nello-claw memory database, then synthesises results with citations. Use when the user asks to research a topic, find out what creators say, compare frameworks, or needs web + knowledge base + personal context in one pass. Triggers on "research X", "dig into X", "find me everything on X", "cross-reference X", "/research".

# /research - Multi-Source Research

Query every available research source in parallel. Synthesise with citations. Save the result to local memory so future queries compound.

## Invocation

```
/research <topic or question in natural language>
/research --scope web      # Exa only
/research --scope kb       # local QMD knowledge base only (if installed)
/research --scope memory   # local memories only
```

Default is all legs in parallel.

## Legs (run in parallel)

### Leg 1 - Web (Exa)
Use the `exa` MCP wired in `.mcp.json`. Query with the topic. Take top 5-8 results. Pull full content via `web_fetch_exa` for the top 2-3 most relevant.

### Leg 2 - Local knowledge base (QMD)
If the user has the `qmd` MCP wired and has ingested any collections (via `/person-kb`, `/book-kb`, `/voice-kb`), query `mcp__qmd__query` with the topic. Default: search all collections. If `--collection <slug>` passed, scope to that one. Retrieve full context for top 2-3 hits via `mcp__qmd__get` or `mcp__qmd__multi_get`.

### Leg 3 - Personal memory
Query the local memory DB at `<install-path>/store/clawd.db`, table `memories`, with FTS5 search on the topic.

```bash
sqlite3 "$CLAWD_DB" \
  "SELECT datetime(created_at,'unixepoch','localtime'), sector, salience, substr(content,1,300) \
   FROM memories WHERE content LIKE '%<keyword>%' AND sector='semantic' \
   ORDER BY salience DESC, created_at DESC LIMIT 10"
```

Also search the vault at `<install-path>/vault/Memory/*.md` for matches, plus any `Person-*.md` files if the question mentions a specific person.

## Synthesis Format

```markdown
## Research: <question>

### Web findings (Exa)
(top 5 results, cite as `[Exa: <url>]`. Pull direct quotes from the top 2-3 you fetched in full.)

### Framework library
(what local QMD collections say, if any are installed. Cite each claim: `[<Collection>: <source title>]`. Direct quotes preferred.)

### Your past context
(what local memories + vault notes say. `[memory <date>]` or `[[Note-Name]]` attribution. If nothing, say "nothing found".)

### Synthesis
(3-5 bullets of concrete takeaways, reconciling contradictions. Every bullet cites its source.)

### Recommended next action
(one sentence. What to actually do with this research?)
```

## After the Synthesis

Save the result back to memories as a semantic memory with salience 3.5 so future related queries benefit:

```bash
sqlite3 "$CLAWD_DB" \
  "INSERT INTO memories (chat_id, topic_key, content, sector, salience, created_at, accessed_at) \
   VALUES ('$ALLOWED_CHAT_ID', 'research-<slug>', '<short synthesis>', 'semantic', 3.5, \
   strftime('%s','now'), strftime('%s','now'))"
```

## Rules

1. **Run legs in parallel.** Never query one source at a time when multiple are available.
2. **Every claim must be cited.** If a bullet does not have a source, drop it.
3. **Never invent quotes.** If QMD returns nothing, say "nothing found" - do not paraphrase from general knowledge.
4. Follow the voice rules in the repo `CLAUDE.md`.
5. **Respect API costs.** Exa charges per query. If the question is trivial, skip the web leg and just use QMD or a local grep.
6. **Feed the memory loop.** Every completed research synthesis gets saved back to memories.

## Prerequisites

- `exa` MCP wired in `.mcp.json` (default for nello-claw installs)
- `CLAWD_DB` env var points to `<install-path>/store/clawd.db`
- Optional: `qmd` MCP + at least one ingested collection for Leg 2

## Want more sources?

If you need Reddit chatter, scraped pages, or specialised search, ask the assistant to install another MCP:

```
find me a connection for reddit search
find me a connection for scraping arbitrary websites
```

The `/find-mcp` skill (already installed) walks through finding + wiring it.

## Relationship to Other Skills

- **`/find-mcp`** - install additional research MCPs on demand
- **`/find-skills`** - find research-adjacent skills (analyse-transcript, compare-frameworks, etc.)
